# Week 6 Projects

This repository has a few projects for you to work on with our skills so far. As always, utilize our ap-principles-notes repository for the detailed information on the skills we've covered.

Each project pulls a significant quantity of data from a txt file for you to work with in an iterable (already programmed) and asks you to perform tasks with the data.

Here is an outline of the three projects:

## names.py

- This contains a list of over 6,000 unique first names (including yours!)
- The exercises include looking for certain names, adding names if not already there, counting the number of names meeting certain criteria (like starting or ending with a certain character), and more.

## grades.py

- This contains a tuple of 10,000 randomly generate grades (30-100)
- The exercises include finding the average grade (including under certain conditions), counting the number of scores that meet a certain threshhold, counting the number of grades in each letter category (A, B, C, D, F), and more.

## bank.py

- This contains a dictionary of over 6,000 "bank accounts". Each bank account has a key of a unique first name (taken from names.py), and a value of a randomly generated amount of money ($0.00-$1000.00).
- The exercises include finding an account, modifying an account's value/adding accounts, adding interest to an account, checking who has a higher balance, and more.
